A practical Management System for colleges.

## For Contributing
### If adding a new Feature :
**Make a new branch and make changes in that branch.**
Later we can finalize and merge the changes in the main branch

### If making changes to previously made file :
**Make changes to the main branch directly.**
However write complete description of the change that has been made

**Do not make changes to the root directory structure and basic skeleton.**
Feel free to make changes inside other modules folders.

**Always use _COMMENTED_ code before pushing to origin!**

**Follow the Directory structure like :**

1) Assets
   - css
   - js
   - img

2) (Any Module)
   - Assets
   - index.php
   - .htaccess

Once Database is designed do not make changes to the database structure files!!!
